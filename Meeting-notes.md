# Meeting Notes

In this file, you are required to take notes for your weekly meetings. In each
meeting, you are required to discuss:

1. What each member has done during the week?
2. Are there challenges or problems? Discuss the possible solutions
3. Plan for the next week for everyone
4. Deviations and changes to the project plan, if any


# Meeting 2.11.2022 2H::0M

**Participants**:

1. Roosa Ahlroos
2. Lauri Karanko
3. Severi Koivumaa
4. Karl Rass

## Summary of works

None of the members had done much prior work yet as the groups were formed a day
ago. We had all read the requirements for the project and the tower defense game
but all of us felt a little bit overwhelmed about where to begin.

## Challenges

1. The deadline for the project plan is 11th of november so a little over a week
   away. This means that we have to acquaint ourselves to what exactly has to be
   done (already written in the requirements) but more importantly what
   libraries should be used to implement those features.
2. After we have an understanding of what work needs to be done, we have to do
   the work division and write the project plan document.

## Actions

1. First we are going to reach out to our instructor to see when they could
   possibly meet with us.
2. We agreed that everyone would all research the tower defense game topic and
   try to find example implementations. This is important because it will give
   us a better understanding of the architecture of the program since none of us
   have designed a game before.
3. We will also look into the SFML and Qt libraries to see what opportunities
   they provide.

> group members and advisor can follow the progress.

## Project status

Short summary of current project status.

### TODOs

1. Everyone is going to research the libraries and ideas for implementation as
   identified above. We will also send out the email to our advisor before the
   end of this meeting.

**Participants**:

1. Roosa Ahlroos
2. Lauri Karanko
3. Severi Koivumaa

We now have a base idea about what and who will be doing what. We have made
decisions on some of the details of our game, but everything is still a work in
progress.

### TODOs
